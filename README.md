# bootstrap-reagent-project
Unofficial bootstrapping script of a [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) project, done in like 32 seconds.

Your time is limited. Just like anyone else, setting up `Clojure + React + Reagent + Yarn + Tailwind + Accountant + Secretary` takes time and undue human effort. Why spend that time when instead, you could use `bootstrap-reagent-project` to set it up for you?

So, let's do it. In a shell equipped with a copy of `nodejs`, `npm` and `clojure`, execute...

```bash
npx bootstrap-reagent-project
```

Answer (one!) basic question, and you will be good to go!
